   - Choose "Normal day"
   - You'll see: "Finish project proposal" (most urgent!)

3. **Complete it**:
   - Click "Mark Complete"
   - Done for the day! Rest well.

### Daily Workflow

**Morning**:
- Open app
- Answer time availability question

**Throughout the day**:
- Work on the task
- If you get blocked â†’ "Can't do today" â†’ Postpone it
- App gives you a new task

**Evening**:

- App shows completion message
- No more tasks until tomorrow

### Pro Tips

## Common Questions

A: Enjoy the rest of your day! The app intentionally doesn't give you more tasks. This encourages realistic planning.

**Q: Can I see all my tasks?**
A: Yes! Click "View All Tasks" from the main menu.

**Q: What if I have no time today?**
A: Select "Very limited time" in the morning check, and you'll get a short task (15-30 min).

**Q: Can I change a task after adding it?**
A: Currently no (v1), but this is planned for a future update.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Locally in your browser's IndexedDB. It never leaves your device.

## Troubleshooting

**App won't load?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Try clearing browser cache
- Ensure you're using a modern browser

**Lost my tasks?**
- Data is stored per browser
- Switching browsers = fresh start
- Export/import feature coming soon

**Build fails?**
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Check Node.js version (need 18+)
- Check the error message in terminal

## Next Steps

- Adjust task estimates based on reality
- Find your rhythm
- Focus on progress, not perfection
