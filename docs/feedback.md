1. on the "today" page when you do your task, you can remove "YOUR TASK FOR TODAY" and "Focus on one thing, You've got this", or whatever inspo message is at the bottom. They are both redundant
2. When you create a new task, it would be good to set a "start" date, ie the first date when this task might appear as your daily. This is because a lot of the time the tasks will be dependent on something else that has not happened yet, so it would be unnecessary to bring it up before then.
3. The ranking of task is still very abstract and difficult. I end up putting all of them as "medium", which is not very helpful. Please clarify exactly what each point in the scale mean when you do the ranking, and perhaps make it a little bit more granular so that you can differentiate tasks more easily. To clarify, please add explanation for each such as "Critical - This simply has to be done, no possibility of avoiding".
4. The number on the top left showing the number of tasks is not close to the clipboard icon, making it not seem as though they are related. You can actually remove the clipboard alltogether, and just let the number be there by itself, since i know what it means.
5. Please add the option to swipe left/right to swap between the views (if possible on PWA's)
