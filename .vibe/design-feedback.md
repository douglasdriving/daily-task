# Design & UX Feedback

## Instructions

Go through your implemented MVP and test the user experience. Document everything you want to change, remove, or improve about the design and UX.

**What to look for:**
- Does the UI look good and feel polished?
- Are there any visual bugs or inconsistencies?
- Is the user experience intuitive and smooth?
- Are there features that don't match your vision?
- Are there elements that should be removed or redesigned?
- Does the design match what was specified in design-spec.md?

**How to use this document:**
1. Go through each feature/page of your app
2. Write down ALL feedback - no matter how small
3. Be specific about what you want changed
4. When done, copy the Claude prompt below and paste it into Claude Code

## Next Steps

Once you've documented all your feedback above, copy and paste this prompt into Claude Code:

```
I need to review the design and UX of my MVP.

Please read the design feedback I've documented at:
.vibe/design-feedback.md

Then read the original design spec at:
.vibe/design-spec.md

Let's go through my feedback items one by one and fix all the design and UX issues until the MVP matches my vision.
```
